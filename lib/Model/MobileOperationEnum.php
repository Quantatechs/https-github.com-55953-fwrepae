/**
 * Inter TT API
 *
 * The Inter TT REST API is described using OpenAPI 3.0. The descriptor for the api can be downloaded in both [YAML](http://localhost:8080/cyclos/api/openapi.yaml) or [JSON](http://localhost:8080/cyclos/api/openapi.json) formats. These files can be used in tools that support the OpenAPI specification, such as the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech).  In the API, whenever some data is referenced, for example, a group, or payment type, either id or internal name can be used. When an user is to be referenced, the special word 'self' (sans quotes) always refers to the currently authenticated user, and any identification method (login name, e-mail, mobile phone, account number or custom field) that can be used on keywords search (as configured in the products) can also be used to identify users. Some specific data types have other identification fields, like accounts can have a number and payments can have a transaction number. This all depends on the current configuration.  -----------  Most of the operations that return data allow selecting which fields to include in the response. This is useful to avoid calculating data that finally won't be needed and also for reducing the transfer over the network. If nothing is set, all object fields are returned. Fields are handled in 3 modes. Given an example object `{\"a\": {\"x\": 1, \"y\": 2, \"z\": 3}, \"b\": 0}`, the modes are: - **Include**: the field is unprefixed or prefixed with `+`. All fields which   are not explicitly included are excluded from the result. Examples:   - `[\"a\"]` results in `{\"a\": {\"x\": 1, \"y\": 2, \"z\": 3}}`   - `[\"+b\"]` results in `{\"b\": 0}`   - `[\"a.x\"]` results in `{\"a\": {\"x\": 1}}`. This is a nested include. At root     level, includes only `a` then, on `a`'s level, includes only `x`.  - **Exclude**: the field is prefixed by `-` (or, for compatibility purposes,   `!`). Only explicitly excluded fields   are excluded from the result. Examples:   - `[\"-a\"]` results in `{\"b\": 0}`   - `[\"-b\"]` results in `{\"a\": {\"x\": 1, \"y\": 2, \"z\": 3}}`   - `[\"a.-x\"]` results in `{\"a\": {\"y\": 2, \"z\": 3}}`. In this example, `a` is     actually an include at the root level, hence, excludes `b`.  - **Nested only**: when a field is prefixed by `*` and has a nested path,   it only affects includes / excludes for the nested fields, without affecting   the current level. Only nested fields are configured.   Examples:   - `[\"*a.x\"]` results in `{\"a\": {\"x\": 1}, \"b\": 0}`. In this example, `a` is     configured to include only `x`. `b` is also included because, there is no     explicit includes at root level.   - `[\"*a.-x\"]` results in `{\"a\": {\"y\": 2, \"z\": 3}, \"b\": 0}`. In this example,     `a` is configured to exclude only `x`. `b` is also included because there     is no explicit includes at the root level.     For backwards compatibility, this can also be expressed in a special     syntax `-a.x`. Also, keep in mind that `-x.y.z` is equivalent to `*x.*y.-z`.  You cannot have the same field included and excluded at the same time - a HTTP `422` status will be returned. Also, when mixing nested excludes with explicit includes or excludes, the nested exclude will be ignored. For example, using `[\"*a.x\", \"a.y\"]` will ignore the `*a.x` definition, resulting in `{\"a\": {\"y\": 2}}`.  -----------  For details of the deprecated elements (operations and model) please visit the [deprecation notes page](https://documentation.cyclos.org/4.16.3/api-deprecation.html) for this version.
